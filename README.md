# Podcast-WebApp

Simple web app to search music and create playlist, similar to Spotify.

Created a small web app to let the user search for music and create playlist and add music to favourite.

There should be a sidebar containing Home, Search, favourites, and playlists :- 

Home: Show the list of user playlist and user favourites music

Search: Type keyword to search music & Auto search complete

Favourites: Display list of music “⭐” starred by user

Playlists: list of music playlist created by user, and also a button to create more playlist.

User need to login and authenticate before going to the home screen.
Authentication will done by keycloak.
